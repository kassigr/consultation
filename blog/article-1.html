            <h2>5 Signs You're Experiencing Workplace Burnout</h2>
            <p><em>November 10, 2025</em></p>
            <p>Workplace burnout is a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion caused by prolonged or excessive stress. Here are five signs to look out for:</p>
            
            <h3>1. Chronic Fatigue</h3>
            <p>Feeling tired all the time, no matter how much you sleep, is a hallmark of burnout. This isn't just normal tiredness; it's a deep sense of exhaustion that interferes with your ability to function.</p>

            <h3>2. Increased Cynicism and Detachment</h3>
            <p>Losing interest in your work, feeling cynical about your job and your colleagues, and emotionally distancing yourself from your professional life are common signs. You may feel a sense of dread or negativity about your work.</p>

            <h3>3. Reduced Professional Efficacy</h3>
            <p>Burnout can lead to a decline in your job performance. You might find it harder to concentrate, make more mistakes, or feel that your work doesn't make a difference. This can be a frustrating and demoralizing experience.</p>

            <h3>4. Physical Symptoms</h3>
            <p>Chronic stress can manifest in physical symptoms such as headaches, stomach problems, and other unexplained aches and pains. You might also notice changes in your sleep or appetite.</p>

            <h3>5. Emotional Dysregulation</h3>
            <p>Burnout can make it difficult to manage your emotions. You might find yourself becoming more irritable, anxious, or even depressed. Small stressors that you used to handle with ease may now feel overwhelming.</p>

            <p>If these signs resonate with you, it's important to take action. Reach out to a professional to discuss strategies for managing stress and preventing burnout.</p>

            <h2>Creating Boundaries in Remote Work</h2>
            <p><em>November 5, 2025</em></p>
            <p>Remote work offers flexibility, but it can also blur the lines between professional and personal life. Here are some tips for creating healthy boundaries:</p>

            <h3>1. Define Your Workspace</h3>
            <p>Designate a specific area in your home for work. This helps create a psychological boundary between your work and personal life. When you leave your workspace, you're "leaving work."</p>

            <h3>2. Stick to a Routine</h3>
            <p>Start and end your workday at a consistent time. A morning routine can help you transition into work mode, and an evening routine can help you switch off.</p>

            <h3>3. Communicate Your Availability</h3>
            <p>Let your colleagues know your working hours and when you'll be unavailable. This manages expectations and prevents you from feeling like you need to be "on" all the time.</p>

            <h3>4. Take Real Breaks</h3>
            <p>Step away from your computer for lunch and short breaks. Don't eat at your desk. Use this time to recharge and disconnect from work-related tasks.</p>

            <h3>5. Turn Off Notifications</h3>
            <p>After your workday is over, turn off notifications for work-related apps on your phone and computer. This is crucial for protecting your personal time and reducing the temptation to check in.</p>
